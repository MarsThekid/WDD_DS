<body>A pixel (short for picture element) is the smallest element in an electronic image. The greater the number of pixels the camera uses to capture a picture, the better the quality of the picture. Digital camera resolutions range from about 4 million to more than 16 million pixels (MP).

The point is a unit of length, point is mostly used when you want to measure the height of a font. But when talking about technically point can be used measure any length. In any application 1 point is exactly equal to the 1/72th of an inch. So 72pt is 0.996264 inches. Let us compare it with the Pixels, the pixels of the one point depends on the resolution of your image. E.g if the resolution of your image is 72 pixels per inch (ppi) then 1 point is equal to the 1 Pixel.
